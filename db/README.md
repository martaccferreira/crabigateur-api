? Three types of vocabulary: `regular`, `irregular` and `verb`

`regular` and `irregular` were chosen as catch-all terms to allow maximum abstraction.

irregular accounts any noun/adjective for which adding a plural is not simply adding an `s` or any noun/adjective that has 2 forms: one for masculine and one for feminine.

regular includes adverbs for which f/m distinction does not exist. but also adjectives for which feminine and masculine forms are the same.
